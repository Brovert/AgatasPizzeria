Feature: Awesome Calculations
	In order to get the results of something really complicated
	As a math idiot
	I want to use the awesome calculation functions

@mytag
Scenario: Add two numbers
	Given I have entered a number greater
	And I have entered 70 into the calculator
	When I press add
	Then the result should be 120 on the screen
